# **3. Plan for Modeling**

## **Tasks**

- Based on your exploration, decide on the types of models to use.
- Consider how to evaluate the system to ensure it is not biased.

## **Steps**

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Based on the data (e.g., structured data with a mix of numerical and categorical features), consider models like:
     - Logistic Regression (interpretable, good for binary classification).
     - Random Forests or Gradient Boosting (handles non-linear relationships well).
     - Neural Networks (if the dataset is large and complex).
   - Ensure the models are interpretable (e.g., use SHAP or LIME for complex models).

2. **Bias Evaluation**:
   - Plan to evaluate the model’s performance separately for males and females.
   - Use fairness metrics like equal opportunity, demographic parity, or disparate impact.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Plan to use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   - Pay special attention to recall for ADHD diagnosis (to minimize false negatives, especially for females).

4. **Document Your Plan**:
   - Write down your planned approach for modeling and evaluation.
   - Include justifications for your choices (e.g., why you chose certain models, how you will address bias).

### **Deliverables for Stage 1**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics and visualizations.
   - Insights about the dataset (e.g., missing values, outliers, distributions).

2. **Cleaned Dataset**:
   - A preprocessed dataset ready for modeling.

3. **Plan for Modeling**:
   - A written plan outlining:
     - The types of models you will use.
     - How you will evaluate the model (metrics, bias detection).
     - How you will ensure explainability (e.g., SHAP, LIME).

### **Tips for Success**

- **Focus on Quality, Not Quantity**: Each visualization or analysis should serve a purpose (e.g., identifying missing data, understanding feature distributions).
- **Document Everything**: Keep track of your decisions (e.g., why you imputed missing values a certain way, why you chose specific models).
- **Ask for Feedback**: If possible, discuss your plan with peers or instructors to ensure it’s reasonable and feasible.

Document Your Exploration
Summarize your findings (e.g., missing values, feature distributions, data integration steps).

Justify your preprocessing decisions (e.g., why you imputed missing values a certain way).

Outline your plan for modeling (e.g., types of models, evaluation metrics, bias detection).
