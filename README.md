# Project Description

Neuropsychiatric disorders that occur in development, like anxiety, depression, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often differ in how and to what extent they affect males and females. ADHD occurs in about 11% of adolescents, with around 14% of boys and 8% of girls having a diagnosis. There is some evidence that girls with ADHD can often go undiagnosed. Girls with ADHD who are undiagnosed will continue suffering with symptoms that burden their mental health and capacity to function.

You’re a data scientist for the NHS. The data science department is trying to free doctor’s time by creating a system that can diagnose ADHD in children and adolescents as a support tool for GPs. In order to develop such a system, the fMRI department has collected functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents which are available to you together with their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information. As there might be gender-based differences, the task is to build a model to predict both an individual’s sex and their ADHD diagnosis using this information.

The company is particularly worried about misdiagnoses in female patients, as they are harder to diagnose with traditional methods. You must ensure that your model is not biased. Furthermore, due to GDPR requirements, your model should be explainable (e.g., you can use SHAP or LIME for this).

## **Project Overview**

The goal is to build a predictive model to assist GPs in diagnosing ADHD in children and adolescents, while also predicting the individual’s sex. The model will use functional MRI (fMRI) data, socio-demographic information, emotional data, and parenting information. The key challenges are:

1. **Gender-based differences**: `ADHD` manifests differently in males and females, and females are often under-diagnosed.
2. **Bias avoidance**: The model must not be biased, especially toward misdiagnosing female patients.
3. **Explainability**: Due to GDPR requirements, the model must be interpretable (e.g., using SHAP or LIME).

## **Key Tasks**

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Load and explore the dataset (fMRI, socio-demographic, emotional, and parenting data).
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and data imbalances.
   - Perform feature engineering (e.g., extracting meaningful features from fMRI data).
   - Normalize or standardize the data as needed.

2. **Addressing Gender Bias**:
   - Analyze the data for gender-based differences in `ADHD` diagnosis.
   - Ensure the dataset is balanced in terms of sex and diagnosis labels.
   - Use techniques like stratified sampling or oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) to address imbalances.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Build a model to predict:
     - **Sex** (binary classification: male/female).
     - **ADHD diagnosis** (binary classification: ADHD/NO ADHD).

4. **Bias Mitigation**:
   - Evaluate the model’s performance across genders to ensure fairness.
   - Use fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity, demographic parity) to detect and mitigate bias.
   - Adjust the model or data if bias is detected.

5. **Model Explainability**:
   - Use `SHAP` (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or `LIME` (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain the model’s predictions.
   - Ensure that the model’s decisions are interpretable and can be justified to stakeholders (e.g., doctors, patients).

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   - Pay special attention to the model’s performance on female patients to avoid misdiagnoses.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.
   - Hyperparameter tuning.

7. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Ensure the model complies with GDPR requirements (e.g., data privacy, explainability).
   - Document the model’s limitations and potential biases for transparency.

## **How to Approach This**

1. **Understand the Data**:
   - Start by exploring the dataset to understand its structure, features, and potential challenges (e.g., missing data, class imbalance).
   - Visualize the data to identify patterns or trends (e.g., differences between males and females, or between ADHD and non-ADHD individuals).

2. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Clean the data (handle missing values, remove outliers).
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract meaningful features from fMRI data (e.g., connectivity measures, activation patterns).
   - Combine socio-demographic, emotional, and parenting data with fMRI features.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Starting with simple, interpretable models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
   - Experiment with more complex models (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) if needed.
   - Use explainability tools like `SHAP` or `LIME` to interpret complex models.

5. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**:
   - Evaluate the model’s performance separately for males and females.
   - Use fairness metrics to detect bias and adjust the model accordingly.

6. **Explainability**:
   - Use `SHAP` or `LIME` to explain individual predictions and overall model behavior.
   - Provide clear, interpretable explanations for stakeholders.

7. **Evaluation and Validation**:
   - Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
   - Test the model on a holdout dataset to evaluate its real-world performance.
