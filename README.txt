The Data folder contains three types of information about 1,200+ subjects. They are:

    a) LABELS: the targets (ADHD diagnosis and sex)
    b) functional MRI connectome matrices (see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbIsfVxuMWM)
    c) socio-demographic information, e.g., subject’s “handedness” or “parent’s education level”, emotions (“Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire”), and parenting information (“Alabama Parenting Questionnaire”). These include both quantitative and categorical metadata.

You will need to process the socio-demographic information and then combine this processed dataset with the functional connectome dataset to create a final training dataset to use in your models.

You also have a file with information about the meaning of each variable.
